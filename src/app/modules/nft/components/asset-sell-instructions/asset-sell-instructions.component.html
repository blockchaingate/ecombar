            Ecombar is <strong>decentralized</strong>,so we never escrow your items. 
            As a result, if this is your first time 
            selling a crypto collectible, you need to complete 2 free (plus gas) transactions:
        </div>
        <ol>
            <li>To initialize your account for making sell orders, which only needs to be done once for your account.</li>
            <li>To allow OpenSea to access your item (or all items in the collection, if the collection supports it) when a sale occurs.</li>
        </ol>
        <div>After those, you'll see a signature request to finalize your listing. 
            In the future, as long as the item was approved in step 2 above, 
            <strong>you won't have any transactions at all, only a signature!</strong> 
            This is how we can (almost) achieve gas-free listings.
        </div>

        <div>Note that you can always decrease the price of your listing for free, without making a transaction or paying gas. You can view all your items <a role="link" href="/nft/collections">here</a>.</div></div>
